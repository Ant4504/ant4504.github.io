      RuneScape 3, which was released in 7/13/2013 was a major change to runescape and was the next generation for runescape adding improved graphics and a new combat system, runescape 3 had kept the inventory and progress of all players so it continued the game but changed some aspects. On 2/16/2013 Old SChool RuneScape was released, it was a reset version of Runescape and instead of being at the time modern RuneScape (RS2) it was the RuneScape 1 the original game released in 2001. OSRS was meant to reset everything changing the economy and to please those who enjoyed the older version. Now it was updated to be RuneScape 2 specifically 2007 RuneScape.

    <p>This website is to see differences between the two game's economies on popular items since they took different directions with their updates and community votes especially with OSRS having a reset and RS3 never resetting.</p>
